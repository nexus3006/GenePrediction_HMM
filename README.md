# GenePrediction_HMM

Checkpoint Summary:


**Week 1: Probability and Gene Regulation**

In the first week, I focused on building a strong foundation in probability and understanding gene regulation.
I learned how to calculate basic probabilities, interpret conditional probabilities, and apply Bayes' Theorem. 

Alongside this, I explored gene regulation mechanisms, i.e. how cells control gene expression at the transcriptional level. I understood the roles of promoters, repressors, and enhancers, and how environmental signals influence gene activity. This gave me insights into how probability and biology often intersect in modeling gene behavior.

**Week 2: Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)**

In the second week, I was introduced to Markov chains and Hidden Markov Models.
I learned that a Markov chain is a sequence of events where the next state depends only on the current one (memoryless property). Then, I explored how Hidden Markov Models extend this by assuming the actual state is hidden, but we can observe related outputs.

I studied how HMMs are used in tasks like speech recognition or gene sequence analysis and got a basic idea of the forward algorithm for calculating probabilities of observed sequences given a model.

**Assignment: Bike Sharing Demand Analysis**

For the first assignment, I analyzed a bike sharing dataset to understand how weather impacts daily rentals.
I merged the training and test datasets, handled missing values, and performed exploratory data analysis. I looked at trends in rentals across different weather conditions, detected outliers using the IQR method, and visualized relationships between rentals, temperature, and humidity.

I also performed a correlation analysis and found that temperature positively affects rentals, while humidity has a negative impact. This project helped me apply statistical reasoning to real-world data and interpret patterns using both plots and metrics.
